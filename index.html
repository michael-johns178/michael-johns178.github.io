            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Michael Johnson is a Software Developer as well as life long creative. My whole life I’ve drawn,
                painted, and composed music.
                The past three years I’ve built and designed furniture. Software Development implemention is a new and
                exciting way
                for me to bring creations to life. I have strong business acumen and have built interpersonal skill over
                the last five years.</p>
            <p> I study and choose my projects carefully to test my abilities. After long hours of research
                I make sure my projects will involve the implementation of a skill that’s new to me but is a signature
                technique of an elite professional in the field. </p>

            <p>The dexterity of being a Software Developer is what I enjoy the most. I’m constantly pushing
                myself to learn new things. Books, audio books, and subscriptions like Udemy are wells I draw from
                daily.
                The drive to grow and inspire. other to grow is deeply written in the code of my personality.
            </p>
            <p> I have an extensive background working in the government and in the private sector. Previous
                employers include JP Morgan Chase and Franklin County Job and Family Services. While at JP Morgan
                Chase I quickly was promoted to an Elite / Business Card Specialist. At Franklin County Job and
                Family Services I once convinced the Ohio director of the ODJFS to reshape the County’s
                method of client intake, applications, and how we secured client data.
