            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Michael Johnson is a Junior Software Developer as well as life long creative. My whole life I’ve drawn, painted, and composed music. 
                The past three years I’ve built and designed furniture. Software Developing is a new and exciting way for me to implement my 
                desire to bring creations to life. I have strong business acumen and have built interpersonal skill over the last five years.</p>
                <p> I study and choose my projects carefully to test my abilities. After long hours of research 
                    I make sure my projects will involve the implementation of a skill that’s new to me but is a signature 
                    technique of an elite professional in the field. </p>
    
                <p>The dexterity of being a Software Developer is what I enjoy the most. I’m constantly pushing 
                    myself to learn new things. Books, audio books, and subscriptions like Udemy are wales I draw from daily. 
                    The drive to grow and inspire. other to grow is deeply written in the code of my personality. 
                </p>
                    <p> I have an extensive background working in the government and in the private sector. Previous 
                        employers include JP Morgan Chase and Franklin County Job and Family Services. While at JP Morgan 
                        Chase I quickly was promoted to an Elite / Business Card Specialist. At Franklin County Job and 
                        Family Services I once convinced the Ohio director of the ODJFS to reshape  the County’s 
                        method of client intake, applications, and how we secured client data.
